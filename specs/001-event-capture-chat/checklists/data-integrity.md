# Data Integrity Checklist: Event Capture and WhatsApp Calendar Assistant

**Purpose**: Validate that requirements define complete, clear, and consistent
rules for event normalization, deduplication, and data quality.
**Created**: 2026-01-28
**Feature**: /Users/dm/code/ananda_bot/specs/001-event-capture-chat/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are required canonical Event fields explicitly specified
  (title, time range, timezone, location, provenance, completeness)?
  [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK002 Are rules defined for merging conflicting fields when
  deduplicating events from multiple sources? [Gap, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for how incomplete events appear in the
  calendar (flagged, filtered, or separated)? [Gap, Spec §FR-006a, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for event updates when a source changes
  after initial capture? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the confidence threshold for discarding detections quantified?
  [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010a]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the allowed range or minimum for per-source crawl frequency
  specified? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002a]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "normalized event record" defined with required field rules
  (for example, start/end time expectations)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do retention/delete/export requirements align with the stated
  retention assumption? [Consistency, Spec §FR-013, Spec §Assumptions & Scope]
- [ ] CHK009 Are deduplication and completeness rules consistent with the edge
  case that non-events should not be recorded? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006,
  Spec §FR-006a, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Can SC-002 (event accuracy) be objectively measured with a defined
  reference dataset and criteria? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK011 Do acceptance scenarios explicitly cover deduplication outcomes
  for multi-source events? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements specified for conflicting time/location values
  across sources (which value wins)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
